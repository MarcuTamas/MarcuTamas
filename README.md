# About me:

##✅ Currently, I am a student at UBB, Postgraduate Training Program in Computer Science and looking for a place to develop and apply new skills.

##❖ In short, I have done a lot of studies in my life 🤓, and for now, I might say I won't stop, because as we develop as grown-ups, we are more conscious about how little we know about everything surrounding us 📖.

##💼 I have a LinkedIn profile that provides more details about my professional experience and skills. You can check it out [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamasmarcu/).
