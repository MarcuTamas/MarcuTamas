## Introduction

✅ Currently, I am a student at UBB, Postgraduate Training Program in Computer Science and looking for a place to develop and apply new skills.

## Background

❖ In short, I have done a lot of studies in my life 🤓, and for now, I might say I won't stop, because as we develop as grown-ups, we are more conscious about how little we know about everything surrounding us 📖.

## LinkedIn Profile
 💼 More details about my professional experience and skills can be found on [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamasmarcu/).
