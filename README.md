## Introduction

~ I was developed by Law ⚖️ and grown by Computer Science 💻 ~

✅ Currently, I am an Expert Volunteer at DNSC and a Computer Science Student in my final year of the Postgraduate Training Program in Computer Science at The Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca and looking for a place to develop and apply new skills.

❖ I am a curious 🤔 and dedicated individual who thrives on acquiring new knowledge. 
<br />
In essence, I am a lifelong learner 🎓.
- The experiences of life serve as a constant reminder of how much I have yet todiscover about myself 💭 and others. 
- They also reveal that everything around me is an
unknown 🔮, fueling my curiosity and driving me to explore and learn as much as I can.
